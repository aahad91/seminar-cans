Comments:
- Slides were OK’ish and, overall, the presentation could have been more convincing so I feel that he hasn’t done justice to the topic.
+ Overview of software isolation techniques was described briefly but any example(s) would have helped to establish clarity.
- There was lack of understanding in some parts (as evident during QA session e.g., running multiple NFs in a single thread and argument to run them over single- and multi-core system).
+ Concluded fine with couple of open problems.


- High-level NFV introduction not too bad
- Slides maybe a bit too superficial ? A lot of content on slide 2
  bullets that might have profited from more text on slide
- I did not really get the big picture problem statement. Basically
  rehashing the netbrick intro?
- Good outline description
- Technical details on Executing, isolation; I did not really
  understand the challenge.
- Oh ok, results first then details. unconventional.
- What does softwrfae isolation mean? how do you get memory isolation
  like that?
- how to get zerocopy like that?
- single thread useful? I did not get that.
- why does TTL drop when moving between NFs? Just in this example?
  - suddenly multi-core? NF chain apples/oranages comparison? (no, but
    still nasty question?)

- Hints
  - "Moving on" clearly overused!
  - space before citations!
  - No hyphen between "three cores" etc.
  - Consistent capitalization!
  - NO RELATED WORK in seminar talks; this makes no sense! You are not
    supposed to put that one starting paper on the spot and take its
    position! (I had pointed this out so many times!)
